FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
==============
Ref in Heb = Hebrew Bible versification  with word number (divided at spaces and metheg) determined by Ketiv

Eng Ref = based on KJV which is followed by almost all English versions. Occasionally a verse break is in a different place - i.e. Num.26.1; 1Sa.21.1; 1Ki.18.33; 20.3; 22.22; 22.43; 1Ch.12.4; Isa.64.1; and all Psalm Titles.

".K" or ".Q" after a ref indicates it is a Ketiv or Qere reading. The Qere is the scribal version in the margin and the Ketiv is the version found in the main text (if it is unpointed, the pointed version has been produced by Westminster and occasionally corrected by Tyndale scholars). Most translations follow the Qere. 
".X" after a ref indficates it is a proposed missing word that is preserved in LXX. The source of the Hebrew is Kittel or BHS, giving preference to the latter. 

Hebrew includes Pointed and Accented forms from Westminster Leningrad text WLC 4.20 via OpenScriptures occassionally corrected towards the Leningrad Codex by Tyndale scholars.
 
Morphology is from ETCBC in the form defined by OpenScriptures at http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html#vt
 - for the source of ETCBC and conversion method by Tyndale House, see https://goo.gl/yKaXQq#HebMorph2
 - ETCBC only parses the Qere. The Ketiv versions have been parsed by Tyndale scholars - see e.g. Deu.33.2-15

Strongs numbers are augmented (with additions of "a", "b" etc) in line with BDB based on OpenScriptures
 and extended into the 9000s to include prefixes & suffixes - as in TBESH - Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
 §numbers represent submeanings within the Strongs number,  added by Tyndale scholars (not fully checked)
 §names represent unique names for people, places and other proper nouns such as months etc.  as in TIPNR - Translators Individualised Proper Names with all References at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
